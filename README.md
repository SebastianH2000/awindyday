# A Windy Day
This is a little arcade game that was inspired by the art and feel of Celeste. You are a little guy named Frank, it's a windy day and blocks are falling on you!

Mobile, 4-player mode, different characters, and controller support haven't been added yet.

First select how many players are playing the game. Then click start to let everyone pick their keyboard controls and their color. After you're all set, click start again to play the game. Left and right move the character in those directions, and the up arrow key jumps. Try to avoid the falling blocks for as long as you can!
